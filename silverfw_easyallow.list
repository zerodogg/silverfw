# in silverfw.conf

# Syntax:
# type_NAME = port/prot
#
# Types are: out for outgoing, in for incoming and both for both
# Prot can be tcp, udp or all (all for both tcp and udp)
# You can define port ranges, or single ports. Ranges are defined as
# FIRST:LAST.
# The name must be A-Za-z0-9
#
# Ex:
# out_ssh = 22/tcp
# or
# out_ftp = 21/all
#
# Prot can also be easyallow which lets you have easyallow definitions
# use other easyallow definitions. This lets you avoid having the same
# defined multiple times.
# Ex:
# out_sshx11 = ssh/easyallow 6010:6016/tcp
