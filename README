OVERVIEW
- - - - -

SilverFW is a simple iptables-based firewall. The documentation
is contained in the manpage ./silverfw.8 and as perl POD inside
the program itself. Access these with either one of these commands:
$ man ./silverfw.8
  or
$ perldoc ./silverfw

After installation just man silverfw should do.

INSTALLATION
- - - - - - -

If you want to run it manually just run ./silverfw
If you want to install it run make in this directory as root.

If you don't want to automatically start the firewall when installing
run make installonly instead.

If you want to install it manually, then read the manual installation
instructions contained towards the bottom of this document.

In order to upgrade it to a new version just run make from
the directory containing the new version and it will be automatically
upgraded.

MANUAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Copy silverfw.init to /etc/init.d/silverfw and chmod 700 it.
Then, depending on your distro you can either do chkconfig --add silverfw
or create the following symlinks:
# cp ./silverfw /etc/init.d/
# ln -s /etc/init.d/silverfw /etc/rc2.d/S99silverfw
# ln -s /etc/init.d/silverfw /etc/rc3.d/S99silverfw
# ln -s /etc/init.d/silverfw /etc/rc5.d/S99silverfw
Lastly, you'll want to copy ./silverfw.conf to /etc/silverfw.conf and use that
to configure SilverFW. Chmod that file to 600.

These directories and when the network starts may be different in your distro
- make sure you check it.
